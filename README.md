# The ball game
This is one of the first piece of code I did in processing 
The game consists of a paddle controlled by the mouse and a ball that bounces around the screen. The game keeps track of the score and lives, with the objective of keeping the ball from falling off the screen while scoring points by bouncing the ball with the paddle.
